# Face Recognition with Python and OpenCV

## DATA
Data obtained from [OpenCV tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d60/tutorial_face_main.html)
- [AT&T Facedatabase](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html)

Contains 10 different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).

- [Yale Facedatabase A](http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database)

The Yale Facedatabase A (also known as Yalefaces) is a more appropriate dataset for initial experiments, because the recognition problem is harder. The database consists of 15 people (14 male, 1 female) each with 11 grayscale images sized 320Ã—243 pixel. There are changes in the light conditions (center light, left light, right light), facial expressions (happy, normal, sad, sleepy, surprised, wink) and glasses (glasses, no-glasses).

### Preparing the data
Write a simple CSV file where its lines are composed by a filename refering to an image and its label (integer).

Download the AT&T Facedatabase from AT&T Facedatabase and the corresponding CSV file from at.txt, which looks like this:

'''
./at/s1/1.pgm;0
./at/s1/2.pgm;0
...
./at/s2/1.pgm;1
./at/s2/2.pgm;1
...
./at/s40/1.pgm;39
./at/s40/2.pgm;39
'''

Once you have a CSV file with valid filenames and labels, you can run any of the demos by passing the path to the CSV file as parameter:

'''
facerec_demo.exe D:/data/at.txt
